setImmediate has higher probability to execute before setTimeout because 
with setTimeout, the event loop has to pass through timers queue performing 
any operations specific to each phase before executing callback, 
but with setImmediate it goes to checks queue of event loop and executes the callback.

The nextTick queue is like priority queue whose all callback functions 
are executed before executing the callback functions of event loop queue. 
Hence, process.nextTick() is always processed before processing setImmediate().
